# PRODIGY_CL_02
A **password complexity checker** is a tool or program that evaluates the strength of a password based on certain security criteria. These criteria are used to ensure that a password is difficult for hackers to guess or crack through brute force or other means. Let's break down the key aspects:

### 1. **Length of the Password**:
   - A longer password is generally harder to crack. Most password policies require a minimum length (often 8 characters), but longer passwords (12â€“16 characters or more) provide better security.

### 2. **Uppercase Letters**:
   - Including at least one uppercase letter (A-Z) adds complexity to a password. For example, "Password" is more complex than "password".

### 3. **Lowercase Letters**:
   - Lowercase letters (a-z) are also important. Passwords should have a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters for greater unpredictability.

### 4. **Digits**:
   - Adding numbers (0-9) makes it harder for someone to guess the password based purely on words. For example, "Password123" is stronger than "Password".

### 5. **Special Characters**:
   - Special symbols such as `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`, and others add additional complexity because they increase the variety of possible characters in the password, making it harder for hacking algorithms to guess.

### 6. **Avoiding Common Words or Patterns**:
   - Using common words like "password", "admin", or predictable patterns like "1234" or "abcd" makes a password weak. Hackers often use lists of common passwords in their attacks.

### **Why Is Password Complexity Important?**
A strong, complex password is essential to prevent various types of attacks, including:
   - **Brute-force attacks**: Where an attacker systematically tries every possible combination.
   - **Dictionary attacks**: Where an attacker uses a list of common passwords and phrases.
   - **Credential stuffing**: Using previously compromised passwords to access other accounts.

### **How Does a Password Complexity Checker Work?**
A password complexity checker analyzes the password and ensures it meets the criteria mentioned above. It typically checks:
- The length of the password.
- Whether the password contains uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Whether there are digits or special characters.
- Whether the password is too predictable or commonly used.

It often gives feedback on whether a password is weak, medium, or strong based on the complexity criteria.
